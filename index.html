			<p>I am a native Texan, a violinist, and a librarian.  I have not worked in a traditional library for many years, but prefer to take a very expansive definition of "librarian" and hence, still consider myself to be one.  I am excited to be pushing the boundaries of the role even further by adding web development skills to the mix.</p>

			<p>I have lived in Austin long enough to become one of those people who reminisces about how it used to be; e.g., I remember when 26th Street was still 26th Street and Dean Keaton/Keeton the name of a character in <i>The Usual Suspects</i>.</p>

			<p>I like to travel, but love coming home to the Hill Country!</p>
